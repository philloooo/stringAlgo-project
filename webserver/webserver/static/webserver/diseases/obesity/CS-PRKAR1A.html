<td>PAT was assayed for PKA activity, cAMP levels, and PKA subunit expression.Results:BMI was lower in adult  CS patients with PRKAR1A mutations. cAMP and active PKA levels in PAT were elevated in CS patients harboring PRKAR1A mutations.Conclusions:Increased PKA signaling in PAT was associated with lower BMI in CS</td>
