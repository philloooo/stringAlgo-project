<td>These effects were likely mediated by the induction of key regulators of fiber transition, PPARdelta (encoded by PPARD), PGC-1alpha (encoded by PPARGC1A)  and PGC-1beta (encoded by PPARGC1B), leading to type II to type I fiber transition and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative metabolism</td>
