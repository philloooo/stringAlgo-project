<td>ZEB1 expression was raised in MYBsh-LA cells and significantly repressed in MYB over-expressing MDA-MB-231 cells, which  also showed reduced random migration and a shift from mesenchymal to epithelial colony morphology in two dimensional monolayer cultures</td>

<td>Finally, we detected binding of ZEB1 to MYB promoter in PMC42-ET cells, and ZEB1 over-expression repressed MYB promoter activity</td>

<td>CONCLUSIONS: This work identifies ZEB1 as a transcriptional repressor of MYB and  suggests a reciprocal MYB-ZEB1 repressive relationship, providing a mechanism through which proliferation and the epithelial phenotype may be coordinately modulated in breast cancer cells.</td>
