<td>We determined the cellular concentration of DNA-PK and other DSB-activated kinases: ATM and ATR and the effect of DNA-PK inhibition by NU7441 on DNA repair, cell cycle, and survival after IR or doxorubicin treatment in three human breast  cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and T47D) representing different breast cancer subtypes</td>
