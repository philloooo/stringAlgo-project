<td>Three findings suggested that chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) explained the  overriding immunosuppression by the FAP(+) cell: T cells were absent from regions of the tumor containing cancer cells, cancer cells were coated with the chemokine, CXCL12, and the FAP(+) CAF was the principal source of CXCL12 in the tumor</td>
