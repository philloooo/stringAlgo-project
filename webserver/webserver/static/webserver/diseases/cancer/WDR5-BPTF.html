<td>H2A.Z nucleosomes around the TSS have higher levels of H3K4me2/me3, which coincides with the recruitment of two chromatin factors, WDR5 and BPTF</td>

<tr class = "cellcolor">
<td>24279307</td>
<td>The observed recruitment is functional, as the active states of H2A.Z target genes are largely erased by suppressing the expression of WDR5 or BPTF, effects resembling H2A.Z knockdown</td>
