<td>METHODS: MYB, ZEB1 and CDH1 expression levels were manipulated by lentiviral small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown/overexpression, and verified by Western blotting, immunocytochemistry and qRT-PCR</td>

<td>Knockdown of ZEB1 in PMC42-ET and MDA-MB-231 cells caused increased expression of MYB and a transition to a more epithelial phenotype, which in PMC42-ET cells was coupled with increased proliferation</td>

<td>ZEB1</td>

<td>Indeed, we observed an inverse relationship between MYB  and ZEB1 expression in two in vitro EMT cell models, in matched human breast tumors and lymph node metastases, and in human breast cancer cell lines</td>
