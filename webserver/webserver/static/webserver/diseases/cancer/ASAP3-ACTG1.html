<td>This study reported that in certain types of cancer cells, loss  of ASAP3 suppressed cell migration/invasion, in part by destabilizing γ‑actin‑1 (ACTG1), a cytoskeletal protein considered to be an integral component  of the cell migratory machinery, essential for the rearrangement of the dynamic cytoskeletal networks and important in diseases, such as brain malformation, hearing loss and cancer development</td>
