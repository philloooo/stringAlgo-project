<td>Gene expression profiling by microarray analysis and functional analysis  was performed to identify the pathway/functions perturbed in ChoK-alpha-silenced  cells, then validated by in vitro experiments.Results:In silenced cells, compared with control, we observed: (I) a significant reduction of both CHKA transcript and ChoK-alpha protein expression; (II) a dramatic, proportional drop in PCho content ranging from 60 to 71%, as revealed by (1)H-magnetic spectroscopy analysis; (III) a 35-36% of cell growth inhibition, with no evidences of apoptosis or modification of the main cellular survival signalling pathways; (IV) 476 differentially expressed genes, including genes related to lipid metabolism.  Ingenuity pathway analysis identified cellular functions related to cell death and cellular proliferation and movement as the most perturbed</td>
