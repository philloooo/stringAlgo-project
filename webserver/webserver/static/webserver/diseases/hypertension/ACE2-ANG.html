<td>Recent studies suggest that prorenin may  act on the PRR independent of the classical ACE/ANG II/AT1 receptor axis, whereas ACE2 may degrade ANG II to generate ANG (1-7), which activates the Mas receptor.  Second, there is increasing evidence that ANG II may function as an intracellular peptide to activate intracellular and/or nuclear receptors</td>
