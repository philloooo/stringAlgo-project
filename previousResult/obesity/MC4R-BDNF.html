<td>The impact of MC4R genetic variation on circulating BDNF in humans is unknown.Objective:To compare BDNF concentrations of subjects with loss-of-function (LOF) and gain-of-function (GOF) MC4R variants to those of controls with common sequence MC4R.Methods:Circulating BDNF was measured in two cohorts with known MC4R sequence: 148 subjects of Pima Indian heritage ([mean±s.d.]: age 15.7±6.5 y, BMI-Z 1.63±1.03), and 69 subjects of Hispanic heritage (10.8±3.6y, BMI-Z 1.57±1.07)</td>
