<td>METHODS: Dual optical imaging of peritoneal metastasis was carried out using luciferase-tagged gastric cancer cell lines and XenoLight CF750 or indocyanine green (ICG)-labeled anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or CEA antibody as a probe in mice with Ivis in vivo imaging system</td>

<td>CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that multimodality imaging consisting of  fluorescence imaging with NIR-labeled EGFR or CEA antibody and MRI allows sensitive, specific, and anatomically accurate detection of peritoneal metastasis noninvasively at an early stage.</td>
