<td>METHODS: We used methylation arrays on samples from several effluents to characterize methylation profiles in CRC samples and controls, as established by  colonoscopy and pathology findings, and selected two differentially methylated candidate epigenetic genes (NPY, PENK)</td>
<td>NPY</td>
<td>PENK</td>
<td>None</td>

<td>CONCLUSIONS: We showed the potential of NPY, PENK, and WIF1 as combined epigenetic markers for CRC diagnosis, both in tissue and serum and tested their use as serum biomarkers in other cancers</td>
<td>NPY</td>
<td>PENK</td>
